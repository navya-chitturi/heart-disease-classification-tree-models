# Heart Disease Classification Using Tree Models

This project focuses on building classification models using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** to predict heart disease. It includes model training, evaluation, feature importance analysis, and overfitting control.

---

## Objectives

- Train and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Visualize the structure of the decision tree
- Control and analyze **overfitting** by tuning tree depth
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier** and compare it with the decision tree
- Interpret **feature importance** using the trained Random Forest
- Evaluate both models using **cross-validation**

---

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** (Google Colab)
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## Dataset

- Dataset: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- A clean version of this dataset was used directly via GitHub.

---

## Results

- **Random Forest** showed better generalization and higher accuracy compared to a single decision tree.
- Feature importance analysis revealed key health factors influencing heart disease predictions.
- Cross-validation provided stable evaluation scores for both models.

---

## Visuals Included

- Decision tree plot
- Accuracy vs. Tree depth plot (for overfitting analysis)
- Feature importance bar chart

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates how tree-based machine learning models can be effectively applied to health-related data, along with how ensemble methods improve performance and interpretability.
